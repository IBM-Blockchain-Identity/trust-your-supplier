# Test Holder

The test holder is a tool for testing the samples during CI (continuous integration).

## Cleanup

When the cleanup script is run, Test Holder tries to cleanup those resouces generated during a demo run that needs to disappear before the next demo run.  An optional, comma-separated list of accounts can also be specified in the  to be cleaned up.
